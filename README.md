# MiniProject1_Martinez_Reardon
Repository for EC601 Mini Project 1. Glenn Martinez and Michaela Reardon

Notes to run this program:
1. Make sure you have twitter and google NLP API's installed on your version of Python. (We are using version 3.7)
2. Change line 12 in Main.py to be the location of your google credentials. These credentials are purposefully left off of the GitHub repository as they contain sensitive information.
3. Update the twitter consumer keys in lines 9 and 10 to your developer keys.
4. Run the main.py in a Python shell and answer the prompts.
